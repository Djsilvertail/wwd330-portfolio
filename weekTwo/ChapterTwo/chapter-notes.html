    <h1>Chapter Two Topics.</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>The importance of well-commented code</li>
        <li>JavaScript grammar ― expressions, statements, semicolons and whitespace</li>
        <li>Primitive data types</li>
        <li>Strings ― string literals, string properties and methods</li>
        <li>Declaring and assigning constants and variables</li>
        <li>Numbers ― decimal, hexadecimal, octal, binary and exponent form, Infinity, and NaN</li>
        <li>Arithmetic operations such as +, -, *, /, and %</li>
        <li>Undefined and null</li>
        <li>Booleans ― truthy and falsy values</li>
        <li>Logical operators ― AND, OR, and NOT</li>
        <li>Our project ― we’ll set some question-and-answer variables and use alert boxes to display them</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>
    <p>Comments are very important when coding. It helps you remember why the code is there and allows others to
        understand your train of thought. It also helps while debugging. There are two different ways to write
        comments in JavaScript, single-line and multi-lined. A single line comment starts with two //. //This is a
        comment.
        Where a multi-lined comment starts with /* and ends with */. /*This is a multi-lined comment that happens in
        JavaScript*/
    </p>
    <h2>JavaScript Grammar</h2>
    <p>JavaScript syntax is very similar to the c programming language and is often called a c-style syntax. Here is an
        example of two statements<br>
        const message = 'Hello World!';<br>
        alert(message);<br>
        There’s no need to actually use a semicolon to terminate a statement because JavaScript interpreters use a
        process
        called Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI). This will attempt to place semicolons at the end of lines for you.
        However, it can be error-prone and cause a number of automated services such as code minifiers and validators to
        not work properly.<br>
        You can also write code in a block of code that is contained inside a set of {}. <br>
        {<br>
        const message = 'Hello World!';<br>
        alert(message);<br>
        }<br>
        A block of code does not need a semicolon at the end.<br>
        Whitespace (such as spaces, tabs and new lines) is used to separate the different parts of each statement.
        You can use as much whitespace as required to format your code so it’s neat and easy to read.
        Examples of this include using spaces to indent nested code and multiple lines to separate blocks of code.
        <h3>Reserved Words</h3>
        The following words arereservedfor use by the JavaScript language and cannot be used to name variables (or
        function parameters and object properties that appear in later chapters):<br>

        abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do,
        double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import,
        in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short,
        static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void,
        while, with, yield<br>

        These words are reserved because many of them are used by the language itself, and you will come across them
        later in this book.<br>

        Some of the reserved words are not used by the language, however; one can only assume they were planned to be
        used at some point, but never were. There are also a few words not reserved but really should have been, as they
        are an important part of the language: undefined, NaN, Infinity.

    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>Comments are ignored by the program, but make your program easier to read and understand</li>
    <li>Data types are the basic building blocks of all JavaScript programs.</li>
    <li>There are six primitive data types: strings, symbols, numbers, Booleans, undefined and null.</li>
    <li>Non-primitive data types, such as arrays, functions and objects, all have a type of 'object'.</li>
    <li>Variables point to values stored in memory and are declared using the const or let keywords.</li>
    <li>Values are assigned to variables using the = operator.</li>
    <li>Strings and numbers have various properties and methods that provide information about them.</li>
    <li>Symbols are unique, immutable values.</li>
    <li>Boolean values are either true or false .</li>
    <li>There are only seven values that are false in JavaScript and these are known as 'falsy' values.</li>
    <li>Data types can be converted into other data types.</li>
    <li>Type coercion is when JavaScript tries to convert a value into another data type in order to perform an operation.</li>
    <li>Logical operators can be used to check if compound statements are true or false.</li>
    <li>Values can be compared to see if they are equal, greater than or less than other values.</li>
    </ul>
